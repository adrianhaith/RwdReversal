function output = KeyResponse(type, valid_indices, resp_consts)
% type is the type of response device (keyboard or force transducer)
% valid_indices are determined from the tgt file, and are used to specify
%     which of the keys or force transducers should be used
% resp_consts are additional constants set in the Constants.m file
